# ConnXusTest
Test completed for interview at ConnXus

## To Run Locally
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. visit http://localhost:3000/

## Changes
I had to use a different api to get coordinates from IP
Couldnt reach http://geo.groupkt.com
Used https://ipstack.com/ instead

## Changes Id like to make
- Make a front-end side to interact with the DOM instead of having to refresh page to update elements.
- Get users IP address using Navigator.geolocation instead of input box
- Use CSS grid to more properly display Tweets
